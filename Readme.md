**Equalizer (C#)**

This is a simple image processing app I created to help me with my design work. It uses Contrast-Limited  
Adaptive Histogram Equalization and Unsharp Masking from OpenCV to enhance images. I use it primarily for  
batch processing of photos to be used as design assets.

To try without building download Equalizer>Wpfapp1>bin>Equalizer.zip, extract to location of choice and  
run Equalizer.exe from extracted folder.
